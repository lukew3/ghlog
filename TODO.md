* Make sure repository exists before trying to get information from it
  * If user deletes the remote repo, errors are thrown

* Option to delete last entry in case a person regrets would rather not publish what they just wrote

* Make a logo for the app

* Make README in Github actions instead of locally if possible
  * Might require adding token as repo secret

* Make sure that folders are written as double digits even if their number is less than 10.
  * January should be saved as '01' not '1'
    * Same thing for days

* It might be cool to have a progress bar when creating a README if it takes a long time when the repo gets bigger

* Rename --get-day option to fit multiple time-periods
  * Make the documentation more understandable

* Option to remove encryption if a user decides that they don't actually want encryption
  * Maybe if you use the -e flag when encryption is already active it asks to make sure you want to remove encryption and then removes it
