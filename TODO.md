* Make a way for users to get entries from a certain time period
  * Use option to get logs from a certain year or month
  * Day already done

* Optimize data transfer time
  * It would be a major improvement if you could just add a line to github repo instead of downloading the entire file and just reuploading everything plus one line

* Make sure repository exists before trying to get information from it
  * If user deletes the remote repo, errors are thrown

* Option to delete last entry in case a person regrets would rather not publish what they just wrote

* Add option to save local copy of repo to make the application faster?

* Add -e option to export to a directory of nested folders and files

* Make a logo for the app

* Make a system where files in directories are uploaded to github and then concactenated into README for simplified viewing
  * README could be made with github actions so that users don't have to do it on their own pc

* Make sure that folders are written as double digits even if their number is less than 10.
  * January should be saved as '01' not '1'
    * Same thing for days

* It might be cool to have a progress bar when creating a README if it takes a long time when the repo gets bigger

* Rename --get-day option to fit multiple time-periods
