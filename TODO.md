* Make sure repository exists before trying to get information from it
  * If user deletes the remote repo, errors are thrown

* Option to delete last entry in case a person regrets would rather not publish what they just wrote

* Make a logo for the app

* Make README in Github actions instead of locally if possible
  * Might require adding token as repo secret

* Make sure that folders are written as double digits even if their number is less than 10.
  * January should be saved as '01' not '1'
    * Same thing for days

* It might be cool to have a progress bar when creating a README if it takes a long time when the repo gets bigger

* Add capability to not pass an argument for -f to get all logs in journal

* Add option to save readme locally

* If there already is an encryption key in config, decrypt and re-encrypt logs currently in Repository
  * Currently, logs are just encrypted twice, thus making the data umreadable
