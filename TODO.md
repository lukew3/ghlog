* Make a way for users to get entries from a certain time period
  * Use option to get logs from a certain year or month
  * Day already done

* Optimize data transfer time
  * It would be a major improvement if you could just add a line to github repo instead of downloading the entire file and just reuploading everything plus one line

* Make sure repository exists before trying to get information from it
  * If user deletes the remote repo, errors are thrown

* Option to delete last entry in case a person regrets would rather not publish what they just wrote

* Add option to save local copy of repo to make the application faster?
